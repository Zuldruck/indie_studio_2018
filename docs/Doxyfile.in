# This tag specifies the encoding used for all characters in the config file
# that follow. The default is UTF-8 which is also the encoding used for all text
# before the first occurrence of this tag. Doxygen uses libiconv (or the iconv

# The PROJECT_NAME tag is a single word (or a sequence of words surrounded by

# The default value is: My Project.

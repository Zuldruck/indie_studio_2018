*
* @section intro Bomberman
* The game you must implement is a Bomberman-like game.
 *
* Bomberman is one of the most famous video games of all time.
 *
* With over 70 franchises, ranging from the first version on MSX, ZX Spectrum and Sharp MZ-700 in 1983
 *
* to the lastest versions on modern consoles, over 10 million units have been sold.
 *
* Our gameplay reference is Neo Bomberman, released on the Neo Geo and MVS systems in 1997.
 *
* Here’s the required features :
 *
* • Local multi-player with the possibility the play with a friend + AI’s controlled bots.
 *
* • A main game menu (to start a new game or load an existing one).
 *
* • Your game must feature 3D graphics but a 2D gameplay.
 *
* • Your game must feature procedurally generated maps.
 *
* • Save/Load a game
 *
* • Animation and sounds to give life to the game (especially during various interactions)
 *
* • Think about bomb explosion, player walking, background music, . . .
 *
* • Some Power-ups
 *
* • Bomb Up
 *
* • Speed Up
 *
* • Fire Up
 *
* • Wall Pass
 *
* The goal of this project is not only to code a video game, but it’s to code a full finished video game. This
 *
* means that the efforts you make to polish your game will count as much as the technical aspect.
 *
* Do your best to avoid clunky animations or graphical glitches, manage your camera in a way that the “outside” of the game is never visible, pay attention to game design, level design and sound design, add variations in ennemies and environnements, etc.
